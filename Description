Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the users choice. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news,books,research articles,search queries,social tags,and products in genral. Recommender system produce a list of recommendations in any of the two ways-
Collaborative filtering: Content-based filtering approaches build a model from the users past behavior(i.e items purcased or searched by the user)as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items(or ratings for items) that users may have an interest in .
Content-Based filtering: Content based filtering approaches uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Content-based filtering methods are totally based on a description of the item and a profile of the users preferences. It recommends items based on the users past preferences. I had developed a basic recommendation system using Python and Pandas.
I had developed a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case,movies. It just tells what movies are most similar to the users movie choice.
